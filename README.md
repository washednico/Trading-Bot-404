# trading_project

Minimum requirements: Implement a simple trading strategy in a robust way. The strategy should involve at least limit orders. Returns are not important, what is important is knowing what you do and verifying everything twice, e.g. verify execution of limit orders, verifying buying power before buying something, verifying whether an asset is short-able before shorting it etc. Nice to have: reporting (graphics?) and/or backtesting
